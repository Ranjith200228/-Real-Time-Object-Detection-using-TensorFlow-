# ðŸŽ¯ Real-Time Object Detection using TensorFlow & OpenCV

This project uses a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model with OpenCV's DNN module to detect and classify objects in real-time from webcam or video streams. It's fast, lightweight, and built for practical computer vision applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This real-time object detection system leverages **TensorFlow's SSD MobileNet V1** trained on the **COCO dataset**, integrated with **OpenCV** for video processing. It detects and classifies 80+ object categories including person, dog, car, bottle, and more.

The model is deployed using OpenCV's `readNetFromTensorFlow`, allowing fast frame-by-frame detection with labeled bounding boxes and confidence scores.
